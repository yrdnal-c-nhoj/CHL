          <span className="smallcaps">WE APPROPRIATE BEAUTIFUL</span> images, scavenged from the infinite scroll of the Internet. Pictures isolate time. They make now into something permanent and forever. We remix them.

          <span className="smallcaps">WE EMPLOY SCRIPTS,</span> tools, libraries, and frameworks built by countless hands all around the world. It is history's most successful group project.
          We copy and we clone and we fork and we install with joy and with gratitude in our cubist hearts.                    
          <span className="line">We code on the shoulders of giants.</span></p>
